Inspired by the colors of these
[diatoms](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/01/arranged-diatoms-miniscule-algae-specimens-arranged-on-microscope-slides/)
and these
[stems](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/stem-by-diana-lange-building-stems-from-colour-with-processing/).

Randomly generate points in a circle, by placing uniform distributions on
radius and length in polar coordinates.

Repeat with a smaller radius, different colors.
